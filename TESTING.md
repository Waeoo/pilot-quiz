### Tested User Stories

- As a new visitor:
- At first sight you are presented with the home page featuring welcome text and asking you to enter your name. After entering your name a button appears to start the quiz.

- As a general visitor:
- Coming back to the site you can enter your name, start the quiz and be presented with a new set of questions. You can after fininshing 10 questions either restart and take another set of questions or return back to landing page where you can enter a new name for the quiz.

- As a returning visitor:
- As a returning and perhaps frequent visitor I look for more questions to take and learn from. I'm looking for new features to be implemented and for the site to keep track of my scores.
